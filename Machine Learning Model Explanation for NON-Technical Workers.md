<h3>To explain ML Model for non-Technical person:</h3>

+
	**Functionality**
		The Functionality of model is must be explain it **without going through Technical Details** and the Development Procedure which is lead to make this Model.
			+ Ask a simple Questions about what is the Target of the model.
			+ Answer the Questions Using Simple Terms Let's say: We went to Know if this Football Team is going to win or not.
			+ Explain Why you did it and explain the task that model is trained for to the human in a simple and easy way to Understand
			+ If non-Technical Person Asked about how the model is work explain it using simple terms and avoid technical terms and state that while the model is trained by X Data the model able to understand the variables and Predict / Classify Regarding to the Data.
+ 
	**Validity**
		The validity is the step that the model can Doing The Tasks it has to do, and as a Machine Learning Engineer the evaluation of the model is evaluated by Testing the model and find the Evaluation scores According to the Task but the metric is cannot be understand it by non-Technical people.
			+ State the task and if the model succuss doing the task According to the Evaluation State that the model is able to perform well and do the task.
			***IMPORTANT NOTE: State about there is chance that sometimes the model may giving wrong result and not performing well.***
		
+
	**Usability**
		This is very subjective regarding to the Case and the person asked so if the communication is happening between Machine Learning Engineer and CEO is better to Explain how this model can be Implemented in the system or the infrastructure that Company's Own
			+ The Point is to Talk about the usability to the model in the perspective of the Listener.
