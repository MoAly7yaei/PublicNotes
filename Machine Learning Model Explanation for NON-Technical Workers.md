<h3>To explain the ML Model for a non-technical person:</h3>

+
	**Functionality**
		The Functionality of the model must be explained **without going through Technical Details** and the Development Procedure that leads to making this Model.
			+ Ask simple Questions about what is the Target of the model.
			+ Answer the Questions Using Simple Terms Let's say: We want to Know if this Football Team is going to win or not.
			+ Explain Why you did it and explain the task that the model is trained for to the human in a simple and easy way to Understand
			+ If a non-technical Person Asks about how the model works explain it using simple terms avoid technical terms and state that while the model is trained by X Data the model is able to understand the variables and Predict / Classify the Data.
+ 
	**Validity**
		The validity is the step that the model can complete the Tasks it has to do, and as a Machine Learning Engineer the evaluation of the model is evaluated by Testing the model and finding the Evaluation scores According to the Task but the metric cannot be understood it by non-Technical people.
			+ State the task and if the model succeeds in doing the task According to the Evaluation State that the model is able to perform well and do the task.
			***IMPORTANT NOTE: State that There is a chance that sometimes the model may give the wrong results and not perform well.***
		
+
	**Usability**
		This is very subjective regarding the Case and the person asked so if the communication is happening between the Machine Learning Engineer and the CEO is better to Explain how this model can be implemented in the system or the infrastructure that the Company's Own
			+ The Point is to Talk about the usability of the model from the perspective of the Listener.
