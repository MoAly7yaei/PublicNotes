## What is Machine Learning?

Machine Learning is an approach often used when traditional software development solutions are not feasible.

For instance, if you have a case with 600 conditions that must be coded to build a solution, it could take forever to complete.

However, Machine Learning is about finding [[Learning Algorithms]] that can learn these 600 conditions and recognize them, even if these conditions are beyond human understanding.

There are [[General Use cases]] that the best practice is to use Machine Learning instead of traditional software development.

In Machine Learning, you provide the algorithm with input and sometimes output, as defined by [[Types of Learning]].

The algorithm is then able to make decisions based on the relationship between the input and output after the training process.

First Learning Algorithm is developed in 1943 when Logician [[Walter Pitts]] and Neuroscientist [[Warren McCulloch]] which is the first mathematical modeling that mimic human brain thinking process.
