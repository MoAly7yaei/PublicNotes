## In General Machine Learning doing 2 Tasks whether it is classify or predict and do it if the model is supervised or semi-supervised or unsupervised (Check the [[Types of Learning]].)
#### There are Many Use cases in order to use Machine Learning but before we discuss about the use cases we have to know that *NOT EVERY CASE HAS THE ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT MACHINE LEARNING*

##### The General use Cases:
- It can be used to predict the outcome of observed or unobserved situation.
- It can be used to Diagnose Unexpected situation basses on the giving measurements.
- It can be used in detect any anomaly situation.
- It can be used to Generate anything.
- It can be used to analyse Data.

##### Example for each General Use Cases.
- Predict Rain Perception
- Diagnose of diseases
- Detect any Credit card Fraud
- Generate Images based on text.
- Classify Affected Signal Towers if there is one tower is down (Network Digredation)
